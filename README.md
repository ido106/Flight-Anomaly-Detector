# Flight Anomaly Detector
### Background
Flight anomaly detection server I programmed as part of Advanced Programming 1 course.  
The program receives flight data from the client and detects if there were any amomalies.  
If there were, the program provides helpful data about the anomaly: when it occured, what type of anomaly took place, what elements were involved, and more.  

### Purpose
The code will be used in Advanced Programming 2 course to write 3 applications:  
1) Mobile app - flight simulator
2) Desktop app to investigate flights and detect anomalies
3) Web app (SaaS) to detect anomalies

### Project elements
1) Design patterns and architecture
2) Communication and client-server architecture
3) Data structures and data-base
4) Data streaming (files and communication)
5) Embedding data-based algorithms within the system we create
6) Parallel programming with the use of threads
7) Event-oriented programming, desktop application with GUI
8) Event-oriented programming, REST style web application
9) mobile application (android)
